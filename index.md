Welcome to Alexander Cyon Consulting AB - I'm Alex, the sole owner of this company.

I'm Swift developer with 9 years experience in mobile development. M.S.cs from [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en). I'm social, entrepreneurial and curious. I love spreading knowledge and learning new things. I also like to automate everything that can be automated.

I'm passionate Open Source about Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT, e.g. Blockchain, DAG) research, development, and adoption. 

I have my dream job at [Radix DLT](https://radixdlt.com) - *giving anyone, anywhere, friction-free access to the digital economy.*
