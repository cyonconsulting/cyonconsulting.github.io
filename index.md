<h2>I'm Alex, the sole owner of this company.</h2>>

<img src="photo.jpg" align="left" height="250" style="margin-right: 15px"/>
I'm Swift developer with 9 years experience in mobile development. M.S.cs from [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en). 

I'm social, entrepreneurial and curious. I love spreading knowledge and learning new things. I also like to automate everything that can be automated.

I'm passionate Open Source about Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) why I cannot find a more company to work for than where I currently work - [Radix DLT](https://radixdlt.com) - *giving anyone, anywhere, friction-free access to the digital economy.*
